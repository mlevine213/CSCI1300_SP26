// The goal of this warm up is to become familiar with writing functions
// The content of this script is focused on calculating shipping costs based on the weight of the package and the destination zone
// The output of this script is the final price for a customer

// 1. Write the preprocessor directive
/**** TODO ****/

// 2. Use the standard namspace to avoid naming conflicts:
/**** TODO ****/

// 3. Write a function named calculateShipping:
// Input: integer for the weight and a character ('L' for local or 'I' for international) for the detination
// Logic:
// - If local ('L'): If less than or equal to 50 lbs cost is $5; If more than 50 lbs the cost is $8
// - If international ('I'): If less than or equal to 50 lbs cost is $12; If more than 50 lbs the cost is $20
// - If destination is anything else, cost is $0
// Output: The total cost with two decimals
/**** TODO ****/

// **************** Stop Here **************** //
// End of class task

// 4. Write the main function:
// - Ask the user for weight and destination
// - Call calculateShipping and store the result
// - If the result is 0, print "Invalid Destination Entered"
// - Otherwise, print the final cost
/**** TODO ****/


// **************** Command Line Reminders **************** //
// We use -o so we can name the executable file and not get a.exe/a.out rewritten every time!

// Windows
// To compile your code: g++ -std=c++17 -Wall -Werror -Wpedantic FunPractice.cpp -o FunPractice.exe
// To execute your code: ./FunPractice.exe (As long as -o was used)

// Mac
// To compile your code: g++ -std=c++17 -Wall -Werror -Wpedantic FunPractice.cpp -o FunPractice.out
// To execute your code: ./FunPractice.out (As long as -o was used)
